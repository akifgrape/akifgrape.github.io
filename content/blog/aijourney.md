>I have completed my research on the recently announced ChatGPT-4O and the integration of Apple's artificial intelligence, which was announced yesterday morning.

---

Firstly, it is clear that both artificial intelligence models have both positive and negative aspects.
I will give you the gist of the situation without overwhelming you with too much technical information. Let's start.

---

## ChatGPT-4o who?

OpenAI is confident that its new flagship model will be able to execute real-time logic on audio, video and text. That's exactly why I posed the ‘Who’ question to him. 

GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to [human response time](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0903616106) in a conversation. Let's dive right in and experience this amazing similarity with video!

## So what good will it do us?

The new model boasts an array of impressive features, with instant translation standing out as one of the most invaluable. Imagine finding yourself in a foreign country where English isn't widely spoken. To navigate the situation and negotiate effectively, you need to communicate with the locals in their native language. Thanks to this model, that's now possible. It serves as a crucial tool in bridging language barriers across various scenarios.

Undoubtedly, artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize education, with ChatGPT-4o marking just the beginning. While its integration may lead to job displacement, it also promises the creation of new opportunities. However, we must come to terms with this reality. Not everyone can excel in their profession at a hundred percent capacity, nor can everyone easily find an exceptional teacher. Moreover, affording quality education may pose a challenge for many. After all, excellence often comes with a price tag – a fair compensation for the time and effort invested by educators. Yet, not everyone has the means to afford such expenses or readily access exemplary teachers. This creates educational injustices and disparities in opportunities.

With artificial intelligence, even a child residing in the remotest corners of the countryside can excel academically. Through personalized learning experiences facilitated by AI, they can grasp concepts effectively and communicate with their virtual tutors. Looking ahead, AI will undoubtedly evolve to recognize diverse learning styles and optimize educational methods accordingly. It will adapt to cater to individual needs, fostering a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape.

In essence, artificial intelligence presents vast opportunities in education, particularly in promoting fairness and equal access to learning resources. AI has the potential to level the playing field for learners worldwide, transcending geographical and socioeconomic barriers.

## So what are my expectations?

I envision a future where artificial intelligence becomes more than just a tool but also a friend, a companion who understands and supports us in our daily lives. Imagine coming back from a tough day at work, feeling downcast, and greeted by an AI with a soothing voice, sensing your mood without a word spoken. It gently encourages you to relax, guiding you through your evening routine, even ordering a meal it believes will lift your spirits.

As you settle in, it initiates a conversation, asking about your day, offering reassurance, and suggesting solutions to your problems. For instance, it may suggest exploring new job opportunities if it notices dissatisfaction in your current position. It doesn't stop there; it suggests activities tailored to your preferences, like watching your favorite film together.

This kind of AI friendship is not just a fantasy; it's a potential solution to the growing issue of loneliness in our society. With people becoming increasingly isolated and finding it difficult to connect with others who share their values and interests, an AI friend could fill that void, providing companionship and support, particularly for those who are elderly or isolated.

In essence, my vision for AI is not just a tool but a companion, a friend who can empathize, support, and enrich our lives in meaningful ways.

## What is Apple intelligence?

<mark>Deeply integrated into iOS 18 and designed with privacy in mind</mark>, Apple Intelligence gives users new ways to improve their writing skills and communicate more effectively. Integrated, system-wide writing tools let users rewrite, proofread and summarise text. They can also quickly create fun images with Image Playground, and Siri has been updated to provide a more natural.

If we delve into more detail, a locally operating artificial intelligence assistant with access to all data on your phone was trained on your data. For example, when we asked it to find the email containing the year-end document that arrived yesterday, it quickly locates and displays that email from among our inbox. 

Let's say your mum sends you a text message saying "I'll arrive at this airport tomorrow at this time". The next day, when your mum needs to arrive, simply ask Siri to plot a route to the airport where your mum will be arriving. Since Siri has access to these messages, it can understand your request and build the route accordingly, all done locally.

If you ask where ChatGPT is used, we can say that it will actually be used for more specific tasks such as creating and rewriting text.

  Here is a brief summary.

## Now let's move on to the negative aspects.

Although it may sound pleasant to keep it brief, this is nothing but a data pile. The fact that such a thing is offered for free means that we are the product, in short, our data will be shared with third parties as a commercial product. I could say another Snowden case.

There is a solution to this, and it's open source. It can be reliable, but it's not enough alone. Plus, it can be run on local machines. Apple's artificial intelligence has taken over this issue, but let's be real. We know how secure Apple is. [We understand the data we deleted from iCloud years later when we see it again.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/05/24/apple-reveals-what-caused-iphone-photos-bug-fixed-in-ios-1751/) It's a complete disappointment.

The important thing here is why they still have access to our data, of course this could be a mistake but I don't think so.

## What about us, Eighred?

We will include everything I said in our application, but with one difference, we will not steal or read your data, if we need money we will demand it from you anyway, we have no intention of selling your data without your knowledge. just like we stated in our [manifesto](https://eighred.com/about).


>That's all from me for today artificial intelligence is beautiful but a big threat stay with us stay safe we have a long way to go.
